<p class="text-warning">Failing to verify that system executables have restrictive permissions is of <b>medium</b> severity.</p>

<h3 style="border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;margin:30px 0 8px 0;">Rationale</h3>
<blockquote>
<p class=""><rationale xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">System binaries are executed by privileged users, as well as system services,
and restrictive permissions are necessary to ensure execution of these programs
cannot be co-opted.

<h3 style="border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;margin:50px 0 8px 0;">Technical Description</h3>
<p><description xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">
System executables are stored in the following directories by default:
<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">/bin
/usr/bin
/usr/local/bin
/sbin
/usr/sbin
/usr/local/sbin</pre>
All files in these directories should not be group-writable or world-writable.
If any file <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">FILE</i> in these directories is found
to be group-writable or world-writable, correct its permission with the
following command:
<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"># chmod go-w <i>FILE</i></pre>
