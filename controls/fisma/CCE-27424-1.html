<p class="text-warning">Failing to verify that shared library files have root ownership is of <b>medium</b> severity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class=""><rationale xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">Files from shared library directories are loaded into the address
space of processes (including privileged ones) or of the kernel itself at
runtime. Proper ownership is necessary to protect the integrity of the system.

<h3 style="border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;margin:50px 0 8px 0;">Technical Description</h3>
<p><description xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">System-wide shared library files, which are linked to executables
during process load time or run time, are stored in the following directories
by default:
<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">/lib
/lib64
/usr/lib
/usr/lib64
</pre>
Kernel modules, which can be added to the kernel during runtime, are also
stored in <xhtml:code>/lib/modules</xhtml:code>. All files in these directories should be
owned by the <xhtml:code>root</xhtml:code> user. If the directory, or any file in these
directories, is found to be owned by a user other than root correct its
ownership with the following command:
<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"># chown root <i>FILE</i></pre>
