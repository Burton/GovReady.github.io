<blockquote>
<p class=""><rationale xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">System binaries are executed by privileged users as well as system services,
and restrictive permissions are necessary to ensure that their
execution of these programs cannot be co-opted.

<p><description xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">
System executables are stored in the following directories by default:
<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">/bin
/usr/bin
/usr/local/bin
/sbin
/usr/sbin
/usr/local/sbin</pre>
All files in these directories should be owned by the <xhtml:code>root</xhtml:code> user.
If any file <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">FILE</i> in these directories is found
to be owned by a user other than root, correct its ownership with the
following command:
<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"># chown root <i>FILE</i></pre>
