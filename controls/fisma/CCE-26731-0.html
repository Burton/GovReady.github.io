<p class="text-info">Failing to verify and correct file permissions with rpm is of <b>low</b> severity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class=""><rationale xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">
Permissions on system binaries and configuration files that are too generous
could allow an unauthorized user to gain privileges that they should not have.
The permissions set by the vendor should be maintained. Any deviations from
this baseline should be investigated.</rationale></p>

<h3 style="border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;margin:50px 0 8px 0;">Technical Description</h3>
<p><description xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">
The RPM package management system can check file access
permissions of installed software packages, including many that are
important to system security. 
After locating a file with incorrect permissions, run the following command to determine which package owns it:
<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"># rpm -qf <i>FILENAME</i></pre>
Next, run the following command to reset its permissions to 
the correct values:
<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"># rpm --setperms <i>PACKAGENAME</i></pre>
