<p class="text-warning">Failing to verify that shared library files have restrictive permissions is of <b>medium</b> severity.</p>

<h3 style="border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;margin:30px 0 8px 0;">Rationale</h3>
<blockquote>
<p class=""><rationale xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">Files from shared library directories are loaded into the address
space of processes (including privileged ones) or of the kernel itself at
runtime. Restrictive permissions are necessary to protect the integrity of the system.

<h3 style="border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;margin:50px 0 8px 0;">Technical Description</h3>
<p><description xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">System-wide shared library files, which are linked to executables
during process load time or run time, are stored in the following directories
by default:
<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">/lib
/lib64
/usr/lib
/usr/lib64
</pre>
Kernel modules, which can be added to the kernel during runtime, are
stored in <xhtml:code>/lib/modules</xhtml:code>. All files in these directories
should not be group-writable or world-writable. If any file in these
directories is found to be group-writable or world-writable, correct
its permission with the following command:
<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"># chmod go-w <i>FILE</i></pre>
