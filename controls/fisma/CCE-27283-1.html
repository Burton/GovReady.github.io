<p class="text-info">Failing to set account expiration following inactivity is of <b>low</b> severity.</p>

<h3 style="border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;margin:30px 0 8px 0;">Rationale</h3>
<blockquote>
<p class=""><rationale xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">
Disabling inactive accounts ensures that accounts which may not
have been responsibly removed are not available to attackers
who may have compromised their credentials.

<p><description xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">To specify the number of days after a password expires (which
signifies inactivity) until an account is permanently disabled, add or correct
the following lines in <xhtml:code>/etc/default/useradd</xhtml:code>, substituting
<xhtml:code><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">NUM_DAYS</i></xhtml:code> appropriately:
<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">INACTIVE=<i>NUM_DAYS</i></pre>
A value of 35 is recommended.  
If a password is currently on the
verge of expiration, then 35 days remain until the account is automatically
disabled. However, if the password will not expire for another 60 days, then 95
days could elapse until the account would be automatically disabled. See the
<xhtml:code>useradd</xhtml:code> man page for more information.  Determining the inactivity
timeout must be done with careful consideration of the length of a "normal"
period of inactivity for users in the particular environment. Setting
the timeout too low incurs support costs and also has the potential to impact
availability of the system to legitimate users.
