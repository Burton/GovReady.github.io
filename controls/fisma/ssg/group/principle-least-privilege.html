<h2>Least Privilege Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">
Grant the least privilege necessary for user accounts and software to perform tasks.
For example,  can be implemented to limit authorization to super user
accounts on the system only to designated personnel. Another example is to limit
logins on server systems to only those administrators who need to log into them in
order to perform administration tasks. Using SELinux also follows the principle of
least privilege: SELinux policy can confine software to perform only actions on the
system that are specifically allowed. This can be far more restrictive than the
actions permissible by the traditional Unix permissions model.
