<h2>Ensure that No Dangerous Directories Exist in Root's Path Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">The active path of the root account can be obtained by
starting a new root shell and running:

This will produce a colon-separated list of
directories in the path.

Certain path elements could be considered dangerous, as they could lead
to root executing unknown or
untrusted programs, which could contain malicious
code.
Since root may sometimes work inside
untrusted directories, the  character, which represents the
current directory, should never be in the root path, nor should any
directory which can be written to by an unprivileged or
semi-privileged (system) user.

It is a good practice for administrators to always execute
privileged commands by typing the full path to the
command.</p>
