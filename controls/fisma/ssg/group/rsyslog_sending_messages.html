<h2>Rsyslog Logs Sent To Remote Host Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">
If system logs are to be useful in detecting malicious
activities, it is necessary to send logs to a remote server. An
intruder who has compromised the root account on a machine may
delete the log entries which indicate that the system was attacked
before they are seen by an administrator.

However, it is recommended that logs be stored on the local
host in addition to being sent to the loghost, especially if
 has been configured to use the UDP protocol to send
messages over a network. UDP does not guarantee reliable delivery,
and moderately busy sites will lose log messages occasionally,
especially in periods of high traffic which may be the result of an
attack. In addition, remote  messages are not
authenticated in any way by default, so it is easy for an attacker to
introduce spurious messages to the central log server. Also, some
problems cause loss of network connectivity, which will prevent the
sending of messages to the central server. For all of these reasons, it is
better to store log messages both centrally and on each host, so
that they can be correlated if necessary.</p>
