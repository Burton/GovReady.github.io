<h2>Software Integrity Checking Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">
Both the AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment)
software and the RPM package management system provide
mechanisms for verifying the integrity of installed software.
AIDE uses snapshots of file metadata (such as hashes) and compares these
to current system files in order to detect changes.
The RPM package management system can conduct integrity
checks by comparing information in its metadata database with
files installed on the system.

Integrity checking cannot  intrusions,
but can detect that they have occurred. Requirements
for software integrity checking may be highly dependent on
the environment in which the system will be used. Snapshot-based
approaches such as AIDE may induce considerable overhead
in the presence of frequent software updates.
