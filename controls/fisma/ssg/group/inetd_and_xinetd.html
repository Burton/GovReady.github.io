<h2>Xinetd Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">The  service acts as a dedicated listener for some
network services (mostly, obsolete ones) and can be used to provide access
controls and perform some logging. It has been largely obsoleted by other
features, and it is not installed by default. The older Inetd service
is not even available as part of RHEL 6.</p>
