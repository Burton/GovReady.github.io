<h2>Print Support Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">The Common Unix Printing System (CUPS) service provides both local
and network printing support. A system running the CUPS service can accept
print jobs from other systems, process them, and send them to the appropriate
printer. It also provides an interface for remote administration through a web
browser. The CUPS service is installed and activated by default. The project
homepage and more detailed documentation are available at http://www.cups.org.
