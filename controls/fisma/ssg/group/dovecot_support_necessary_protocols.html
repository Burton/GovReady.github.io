<h2>Support Only the Necessary Protocols Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">Dovecot supports the IMAP and POP3 protocols, as well as 
SSL-protected versions of those protocols. Configure the Dovecot server 
to support only the protocols needed by your site. Edit . 
Add or correct the following lines, replacing  with 
only the subset of protocols (, , 
, ) required:

If possible, require SSL protection for all transactions. The SSL 
protocol variants listen on alternate ports (995 instead of 110 for 
pop3s, and 993 instead of 143 for imaps), and require SSL-aware clients. 
An alternate approach is to listen on the standard port and require the 
client to use the STARTTLS command before authenticating.
