<h2>Set Password Expiration Parameters Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">The file  controls several
password-related settings. Programs such as ,
, and
 consult  to determine
behavior with regard to password aging, expiration warnings,
and length. See the man page  for more information.

Users should be forced to change their passwords, in order to
decrease the utility of compromised passwords. However, the need to
change passwords often should be balanced against the risk that
users will reuse or write down passwords if forced to change them
too often. Forcing password changes every 90-360 days, depending on
the environment, is recommended. Set the appropriate value as
 and apply it to existing accounts with the
 flag.

The  () setting prevents password
changes for 7 days after the first change, to discourage password
cycling. If you use this setting, train users to contact an administrator
for an emergency password change in case a new password becomes
compromised. The  () setting gives
users 7 days of warnings at login time that their passwords are about to expire.

For example, for each existing human user , expiration parameters
could be adjusted to a 180 day maximum password age, 7 day minimum password
age, and 7 day warning period with the following command:
