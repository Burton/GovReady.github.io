<h2>NFS and RPC Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">The Network File System is a popular distributed filesystem for
the Unix environment, and is very widely deployed.  This section discusses the
circumstances under which it is possible to disable NFS and its dependencies,
and then details steps which should be taken to secure
NFS's configuration. This section is relevant to machines operating as NFS
clients, as well as to those operating as NFS servers.
