<h2>Configure Syslog Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">The syslog service has been the default Unix logging mechanism for
many years. It has a number of downsides, including inconsistent log format,
lack of authentication for received messages, and lack of authentication,
encryption, or reliable transport for messages sent over a network. However,
due to its long history, syslog is a de facto standard which is supported by
almost all Unix applications.


In RHEL 6, rsyslog has replaced ksyslogd as the
syslog daemon of choice, and it includes some additional security features
such as reliable, connection-oriented (i.e. TCP) transmission of logs, the
option to log to database formats, and the encryption of log data en route to
a central logging server.
This section discusses how to configure rsyslog for
best effect, and how to use tools provided with the system to maintain and
monitor logs.</p>
