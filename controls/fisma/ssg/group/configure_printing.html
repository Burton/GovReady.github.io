<h2>Configure the CUPS Service if Necessary Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">CUPS provides the ability to easily share local printers with
other machines over the network. It does this by allowing machines to share
lists of available printers. Additionally, each machine that runs the CUPS
service can potentially act as a print server. Whenever possible, the printer
sharing and print server capabilities of CUPS should be limited or disabled.
The following recommendations should demonstrate how to do just that.
