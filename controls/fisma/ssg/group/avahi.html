<h2>Avahi Server Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">The Avahi daemon implements the DNS Service Discovery
and Multicast DNS protocols, which provide service and host
discovery on a network. It allows a system to automatically
identify resources on the network, such as printers or web servers.
This capability is also known as mDNSresponder and is a major part
of Zeroconf networking. </p>
