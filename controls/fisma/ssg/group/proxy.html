<h2>Proxy Server Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">A proxy server is a very desirable target for a
potential adversary because much (or all) sensitive data for a
given infrastructure may flow through it. Therefore, if one is
required, the machine acting as a proxy server should be dedicated
to that purpose alone and be stored in a physically secure
location. The system's default proxy server software is Squid, and
provided in an RPM package of the same name.</p>
