<h2>File Permissions and Masks Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">Traditional Unix security relies heavily on file and
directory permissions to prevent unauthorized users from reading or
modifying files to which they should not have access. 

Several of the commands in this section search filesystems
for files or directories with certain characteristics, and are
intended to be run on every local partition on a given machine.
When the variable  appears in one of the commands below,
it means that the command is intended to be run repeatedly, with the
name of each local partition substituted for  in turn.

The following command prints a list of all ext4 partitions on the local
system, which is the default filesystem for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
6 installations:

For any systems that use a different
local filesystem type, modify this command as appropriate.
