<h2>NIS Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">The Network Information Service (NIS), also known as 'Yellow
Pages' (YP), and its successor NIS+ have been made obsolete by
Kerberos, LDAP, and other modern centralized authentication
services. NIS should not be used because it suffers from security
problems inherent in its design, such as inadequate protection of
important authentication information.</p>
