<h2>Enable SELinux Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">Edit the file . Add or correct the
following lines:

Edit the file . Ensure that the following
arguments DO NOT appear on any kernel command line in the file:

The directive  enables SELinux at boot time.
If SELinux is suspected of involvement with boot-time problems
(unlikely), it is possible to boot into the warning-only mode
 for debugging purposes. Make certain to change
the mode back to enforcing after debugging, set the filesystems to
be relabeled for consistency using the command , and reboot.

However, the RHEL 6 default SELinux configuration should be
sufficiently reasonable that most systems will boot without serious
problems. Some applications that require deep or unusual system
privileges, such as virtual machine software, may not be compatible
with SELinux in its default configuration. However, this should be
uncommon, and SELinux's application support continues to improve.
In other cases, SELinux may reveal unusual or insecure program
behavior by design.

The directive  configures SELinux to use
the default targeted policy.

The SELinux boot mode specified in  can be
overridden by command-line arguments passed to the kernel. It is
necessary to check  to ensure that this has not been done
and to protect the boot process.
