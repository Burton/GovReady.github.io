<h2>Encrypt Transmitted Data Whenever Possible Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">
Data transmitted over a network, whether wired or wireless, is susceptible
to passive monitoring. Whenever practical solutions for encrypting
such data exist, they should be applied. Even if data is expected to
be transmitted only over a local network, it should still be encrypted.
Encrypting authentication data, such as passwords, is particularly
important. Networks of RHEL 6 machines can and should be configured
so that no unencrypted authentication data is ever transmitted between
machines.
