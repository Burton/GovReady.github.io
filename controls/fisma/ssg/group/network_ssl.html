<h2>Transport Layer Security Support Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">
Support for Transport Layer Security (TLS), and its predecessor, the Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL), is included in RHEL in the OpenSSL software (RPM package
).  TLS provides encrypted and authenticated network
communications, and many network services include support for it.  TLS or SSL
can be leveraged to avoid any plaintext transmission of sensitive data.

For information on how to use OpenSSL, see
.  Information on FIPS validation
of OpenSSL is available at 
and .
