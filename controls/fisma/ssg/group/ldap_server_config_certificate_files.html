<h2>Install and Protect LDAP Certificate Files Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">Create the PKI directory for LDAP certificates if it does not already exist:

Using removable media or some other secure transmission format, install the certificate files
onto the LDAP server:

Verify the ownership and permissions of these files:

Verify that the CA's public certificate file has been installed as
, and has the correct permissions:


As a result of these steps, the LDAP server will have access to its own private
certificate and the key with which that certificate is encrypted, and to the
public certificate file belonging to the CA. Note that it would be possible for
the key to be protected further, so that processes running as ldap could not
read it. If this were done, the LDAP server process would need to be restarted
manually whenever the server rebooted.
