<h2>Introduction Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">
The purpose of this guidance is to provide security configuration
recommendations and baselines for the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6 operating
system. The guidance provided here should be applicable to all variants
(Desktop, Server, Advanced Platform) of the product. Recommended
settings for the basic operating system are provided, as well as for many
network services that the system can provide to other systems.
The guide is intended for system administrators. Readers are assumed to
possess basic system administration skills for Unix-like systems, as well
as some familiarity with Red Hat's documentation and administration
conventions. Some instructions within this guide are complex.
All directions should be followed completely and with understanding of
their effects in order to avoid serious adverse effects on the system
and its security.
