<h2>Set Password Quality Requirements Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">The default  PAM module provides strength
checking for passwords. It performs a number of checks, such as
making sure passwords are not similar to dictionary words, are of
at least a certain length, are not the previous password reversed,
and are not simply a change of case from the previous password. It
can also require passwords to be in certain character classes.

The  PAM module also provides the ability to enforce
stringent password strength requirements. It is provided
in an RPM of the same name.

The man pages  and 
provide information on the capabilities and configuration of
each.</p>
