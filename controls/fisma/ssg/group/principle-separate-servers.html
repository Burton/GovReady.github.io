<h2>Run Different Network Services on Separate Systems Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">
Whenever possible, a server should be dedicated to serving exactly one
network service. This limits the number of other services that can
be compromised in the event that an attacker is able to successfully
exploit a software flaw in one network service.
