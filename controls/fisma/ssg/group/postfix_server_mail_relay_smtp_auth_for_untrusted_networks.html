<h2>Require SMTP AUTH Before Relaying from Untrusted Clients Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">SMTP authentication allows remote clients to relay mail safely by
requiring them to authenticate before submitting mail. Postfix's SMTP AUTH uses
an authentication library called SASL, which is not part of Postfix itself.  To
enable the use of SASL authentication, see
http://www.postfix.org/SASL_README.html
