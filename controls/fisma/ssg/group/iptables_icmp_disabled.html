<h2>Restrict ICMP Message Types Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">In , the accepted ICMP messages
types can be restricted. To accept only ICMP echo reply, destination
unreachable, and time exceeded messages, remove the line:

and insert the lines:

To allow the system to respond to pings, also insert the following line:

Ping responses can also be limited to certain networks or hosts by using the -s
option in the previous rule.  Because IPv6 depends so heavily on ICMPv6, it is
preferable to deny the ICMPv6 packets you know you don't need (e.g. ping
requests) in , while letting everything else
through:

If you are going to statically configure the machine's address, it should
ignore Router Advertisements which could add another IPv6 address to the
interface or alter important network settings:

Restricting ICMPv6 message types in  is not
recommended because the operation of IPv6 depends heavily on ICMPv6. Thus, great
care must be taken if any other ICMPv6 types are blocked.
