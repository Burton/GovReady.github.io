<h2>SNMP Server Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">The Simple Network Management Protocol allows
administrators to monitor the state of network devices, including
computers. Older versions of SNMP were well-known for weak
security, such as plaintext transmission of the community string
(used for authentication) and usage of easily-guessable
choices for the community string.</p>
