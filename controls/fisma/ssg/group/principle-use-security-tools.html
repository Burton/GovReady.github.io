<h2>Configure Security Tools to Improve System Robustness Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">
Several tools exist which can be effectively used to improve a system's
resistance to and detection of unknown attacks. These tools can improve
robustness against attack at the cost of relatively little configuration
effort. In particular, this guide recommends and discusses the use of
Iptables for host-based firewalling, SELinux for protection against
vulnerable services, and a logging and auditing infrastructure for
detection of problems.
