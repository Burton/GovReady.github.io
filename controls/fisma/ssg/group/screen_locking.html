<h2>Configure Screen Locking Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">When a user must temporarily leave an account
logged-in, screen locking should be employed to prevent passersby
from abusing the account. User education and training is
particularly important for screen locking to be effective, and policies
can be implemented to reinforce this.

Automatic screen locking is only meant as a safeguard for
those cases where a user forgot to lock the screen.</p>
