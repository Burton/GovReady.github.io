<h2>DHCP Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) allows
systems to request and obtain an IP address and other configuration
parameters from a server.

This guide recommends configuring networking on clients by manually editing
the appropriate files under .  Use of DHCP can make client 
systems vulnerable to compromise by rogue DHCP servers, and should be avoided 
unless necessary.  If using DHCP is necessary, however, there are best practices 
that should be followed to minimize security risk.
