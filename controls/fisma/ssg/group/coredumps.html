<h2>Disable Core Dumps Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">A core dump file is the memory image of an executable
program when it was terminated by the operating system due to
errant behavior. In most cases, only software developers
legitimately need to access these files. The core dump files may
also contain sensitive information, or unnecessarily occupy large
amounts of disk space.

Once a hard limit is set in , a
user cannot increase that limit within his or her own session. If access
to core dumps is required, consider restricting them to only
certain users or groups. See the  man page for more
information.

The core dumps of setuid programs are further protected. The
 variable  controls whether
the kernel allows core dumps from these programs at all. The default
value of 0 is recommended.</p>
