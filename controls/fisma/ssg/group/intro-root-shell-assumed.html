<h2>Root Shell Environment Assumed Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">
Most of the actions listed in this document are written with the
assumption that they will be executed by the root user running the
 shell. Commands preceded with a hash mark (#)
assume that the administrator will execute the commands as root, i.e.
apply the command via  whenever possible, or use
 to gain root privileges if  cannot be
used. Commands which can be executed as a non-root user are are preceded
by a dollar sign ($) prompt.
