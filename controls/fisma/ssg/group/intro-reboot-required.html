<h2>Reboot Required Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">
A system reboot is implicitly required after some actions in order to
complete the reconfiguration of the system. In many cases, the changes
will not take effect until a reboot is performed. In order to ensure
that changes are applied properly and to test functionality, always
reboot the system after applying a set of recommendations from this guide.
