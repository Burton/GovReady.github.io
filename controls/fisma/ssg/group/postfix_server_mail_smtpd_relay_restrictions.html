<h2>Enact SMTP Relay Restrictions Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">
To configure Postfix to restrict addresses to which it
will send mail, see:
http://www.postfix.org/SMTPD_ACCESS_README.html#danger

The full contents of  will
vary by site, since this is a common place to put spam restrictions and other
site-specific options. The  option allows all mail to
be relayed from the machines in . Then, the
 option denies all mail whose destination
address is not local, preventing any other machines from relaying. These two
options should always appear in this order, and should usually follow one
another immediately unless SMTP AUTH is used.
