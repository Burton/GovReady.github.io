<h2>Log and Drop Packets with Suspicious Source Addresses Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">Packets with non-routable source addresses should be rejected, as they may indicate spoofing. Because the
modified policy will reject non-matching packets, you only need to add these rules if you are interested in also
logging these spoofing or suspicious attempts before they are dropped. If you do choose to log various suspicious
traffic, add identical rules with a target of DROP after each LOG.
To log and then drop these IPv4 packets, insert the following rules in  (excepting
any that are intentionally used):

Similarly, you might wish to log packets containing some IPv6 reserved addresses if they are not expected
on your network:

If you are not expecting to see site-local multicast or auto-tunneled traffic, you can log those:

If you wish to block multicasts to all link-local nodes (e.g. if you are not using router auto-configuration and
do not plan to have any services that multicast to the entire local network), you can block the link-local
all-nodes multicast address (before accepting incoming ICMPv6):

However, if you're going to allow IPv4 compatible IPv6 addresses (of the form ::0.0.0.0/96), you should
then consider logging the non-routable IPv4-compatible addresses:

If you are not expecting to see any IPv4 (or IPv4-compatible) traffic on your network, consider logging it before it gets dropped:

The following rule will log all traffic originating from a site-local address, which is deprecated address space:
