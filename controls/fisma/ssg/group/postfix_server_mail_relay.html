<h2>Control Mail Relaying Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">Postfix's mail relay controls are implemented with the help of the
smtpd recipient restrictions option, which controls the restrictions placed on
the SMTP dialogue once the sender and recipient envelope addresses are known.
The guidance in the following sections should be applied to all machines. If
there are machines which must be allowed to relay mail, but which cannot be
trusted to relay unconditionally, configure SMTP AUTH with SSL support.
