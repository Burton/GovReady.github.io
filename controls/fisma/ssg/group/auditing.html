<h2>System Accounting with auditd Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">The audit service provides substantial capabilities
for recording system activities. By default, the service audits about
SELinux AVC denials and certain types of security-relevant events
such as system logins, account modifications, and authentication
events performed by programs such as sudo.
Under its default configuration,  has modest disk space
requirements, and should not noticeably impact system performance.

Government networks often have substantial auditing
requirements and  can be configured to meet these
requirements.
Examining some example audit records demonstrates how the Linux audit system
satisfies common requirements.  
The following example from Fedora Documentation available at 

shows the substantial amount of information captured in a
two typical "raw" audit messages, followed by a breakdown of the most important
fields. In this example the message is SELinux-related and reports an AVC
denial (and the associated system call) that occurred when the Apache HTTP
Server attempted to access the  file (labeled with
the  type):
