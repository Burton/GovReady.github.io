<h2>Limit Network-Transmitted Configuration if Using Static IPv6 Addresses Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">To limit the configuration information requested from other
systems and accepted from the network on a system that uses
statically-configured IPv6 addresses, add the following lines to
:

The  setting determines how many router
solicitations are sent when bringing up the interface. If addresses are
statically assigned, there is no need to send any solicitations.

The  setting controls whether the system will accept
prefix info from the router.

The  setting controls whether the system will accept
Hop Limit settings from a router advertisement. Setting it to 0 prevents a
router from changing your default IPv6 Hop Limit for outgoing packets.

The  setting controls whether router advertisements can cause
the system to assign a global unicast address to an interface.

The  setting determines how many neighbor solicitations
to send out per address (global and link-local) when bringing up an interface
to ensure the desired address is unique on the network.

The  setting determines how many global unicast IPv6
addresses can be assigned to each interface.  The default is 16, but it should
be set to exactly the number of statically configured global addresses
required.
