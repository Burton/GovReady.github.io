<h2>Read Sections Completely and in Order Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">
Each section may build on information and recommendations discussed in
prior sections. Each section should be read and understood completely;
instructions should never be blindly applied. Relevant discussion may
occur after instructions for an action.
