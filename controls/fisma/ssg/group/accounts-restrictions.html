<h2>Protect Accounts by Restricting Password-Based Login Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">Conventionally, Unix shell accounts are accessed by
providing a username and password to a login program, which tests
these values for correctness using the  and
 files. Password-based login is vulnerable to
guessing of weak passwords, and to sniffing and man-in-the-middle
attacks against passwords entered over a network or at an insecure
console. Therefore, mechanisms for accessing accounts by entering
usernames and passwords should be restricted to those which are
operationally necessary.</p>
