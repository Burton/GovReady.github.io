<h2>Configure the Exports File Restrictively Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">Linux's NFS implementation uses the file  to control what filesystems
and directories may be accessed via NFS. (See the  manpage for more information about the
format of this file.)

The syntax of the  file is not necessarily checked fully on reload, and syntax errors
can leave your NFS configuration more open than intended. Therefore, exercise caution when modifying
the file.

The syntax of each line in  is:

where  is a directory or filesystem to export,  is an IP address, netblock,
hostname, domain, or netgroup to which to export, and  is an option.
