<h2>Restrict Programs from Dangerous Execution Patterns Rules </small></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="">The recommendations in this section are designed to
ensure that the system's features to protect against potentially
dangerous program execution are activated.
These protections are applied at the system initialization or
kernel level, and defend against certain types of badly-configured
or compromised programs.</p>
