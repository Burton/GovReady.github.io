<p class=""><rationale xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">Allowing client requests to be made from ports higher than 1024 could allow a unprivileged

attacker could gain access to data on the NFS server.</rationale></p>

<p><description xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">By default, the server NFS implementation requires that all client requests be made
from ports less than 1024. If your organization has control over machines connected to its
network, and if NFS requests are prohibited at the border firewall, this offers some protection
against malicious requests from unprivileged users. Therefore, the default should not be changed.

To ensure that the default has not been changed, ensure no line in
<xhtml:code>/etc/exports</xhtml:code> contains the option <xhtml:code>insecure</xhtml:code>.
