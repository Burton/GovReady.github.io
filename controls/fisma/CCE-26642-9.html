<p class=""><rationale xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">
Allowing a user account to own a world-writable directory is
undesirable because it allows the owner of that directory to remove
or replace any files that may be placed in the directory by other
users.

<p><description xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">All directories in local partitions which are
world-writable should be owned by root or another
system account.  If any world-writable directories are not
owned by a system account, this should be investigated.
Following this, the files should be deleted or assigned to an
appropriate group.
