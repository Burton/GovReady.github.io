<p class="text-info">Failing to restrict information published by avahi is of <b>low</b> severity.</p>

<h3 style="border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;margin:30px 0 8px 0;">Rationale</h3>
<blockquote>
<p class=""><rationale xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">
These options prevent publishing attempts from succeeding,
and can be applied even if publishing is disabled entirely via
disable-publishing. Alternatively, these can be used to restrict
the types of published information in the event that some information
must be published.

<h3 style="border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;margin:50px 0 8px 0;">Technical Description</h3>
<p><description xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">
If it is necessary to publish some information to the network, it should not be joined
by any extraneous information, or by information supplied by a non-trusted source
on the system.
Prevent user applications from using Avahi to publish services by adding or
correcting the following line in the <xhtml:code>[publish]</xhtml:code> section:
<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">disable-user-service-publishing=yes</pre>
Implement as many of the following lines as possible, to restrict the information
published by Avahi.
<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">publish-addresses=no
publish-hinfo=no
publish-workstation=no
publish-domain=no</pre>
Inspect the files in the directory <xhtml:code>/etc/avahi/services/</xhtml:code>. Unless there
is an operational need to publish information about each of these services,
delete the corresponding file.
