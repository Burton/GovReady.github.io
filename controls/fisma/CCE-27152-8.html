<p class="text-info">Failing to ensure system is not acting as a network sniffer is of <b>low</b> severity.</p>

<h3 style="border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;margin:30px 0 8px 0;">Rationale</h3>
<blockquote>
<p class=""><rationale xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">If any results are returned, then a sniffing process (such as tcpdump
or Wireshark) is likely to be using the interface and this should be
investigated.

<p><description xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">The system should not be acting as a network sniffer, which can
capture all traffic on the network to which it is connected. Run the following
to determine if any interface is running in promiscuous mode:
<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">$ ip link | grep PROMISC</pre>
