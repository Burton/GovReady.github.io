<p class="text-warning">Failing to ensure no world-writable files exist is of <b>medium</b> severity.</p>

<h3 style="border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;margin:30px 0 8px 0;">Rationale</h3>
<blockquote>
<p class=""><rationale xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">
Data in world-writable files can be modified by any
user on the system. In almost all circumstances, files can be
configured using a combination of user and group permissions to
support whatever legitimate access is needed without the risk
caused by world-writable files.</rationale></p>

<p><description xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">It is generally a good idea to remove global (other) write
access to a file when it is discovered. However, check with
documentation for specific applications before making changes.
Also, monitor for recurring world-writable files, as these may be
symptoms of a misconfigured application or user
account.</description></p>
