<p><description xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">By default the NFS server requires secure file-lock requests,
which require credentials from the client in order to lock a file. Most NFS
clients send credentials with file lock requests, however, there are a few
clients that do not send credentials when requesting a file-lock, allowing the
client to only be able to lock world-readable files. To get around this, the
<xhtml:code>insecure_locks</xhtml:code> option can be used so these clients can access the
desired export. This poses a security risk by potentially allowing the client
access to data for which it does not have authorization.
Remove any instances of the 
<xhtml:code>insecure_locks</xhtml:code> option from the file <xhtml:code>/etc/exports</xhtml:code>.
