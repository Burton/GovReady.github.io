<p class="text-warning">Failing to verify only root has uid 0 is of <b>medium</b> severity.</p>

<h3 style="border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;margin:30px 0 8px 0;">Rationale</h3>
<blockquote>
<p class=""><rationale xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">
An account has root authority if it has a UID of 0. Multiple accounts
with a UID of 0 afford more opportunity for potential intruders to
guess a password for a privileged account. Proper configuration of
sudo is recommended to afford multiple system administrators
access to root privileges in an accountable manner.

<p><description xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">
If any account other than root has a UID of 0,
this misconfiguration should be investigated and the
accounts other than root should be removed or have their UID changed.
