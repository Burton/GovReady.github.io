<p><description xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">
Install virus scanning software, which uses signatures to search for the
presence of viruses on the filesystem. 
The McAfee uvscan virus scanning tool is provided for DoD systems.
Ensure virus definition files are no older than 7 days, or their last release.
<!-- need info here on where DoD admins can go to get this -->
Configure the virus scanning software to perform scans dynamically on all
accessed files.  If this is not possible, configure the
system to scan all altered files on the system on a daily
basis. If the system processes inbound SMTP mail, configure the virus scanner
to scan all received mail.
<!-- what's the basis for the IAO language? would not failure of a check
     imply a discussion, for every check in this document, 
     with the IAO (or SSO or ISSO or ISSM or whatever is the right acronym in your
     particular neighborhood) should occur? -->
