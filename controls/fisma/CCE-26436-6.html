<p class="text-info">Failing to ensure /var/log/audit located on separate partition is of <b>low</b> severity.</p>

<h3 style="border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;margin:30px 0 8px 0;">Rationale</h3>
<blockquote>
<p class=""><rationale xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">
Placing <xhtml:code>/var/log/audit</xhtml:code> in its own partition
enables better separation between audit files
and other files, and helps ensure that
auditing cannot be halted due to the partition running out
of space.

<p><description xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">
Audit logs are stored in the <xhtml:code>/var/log/audit</xhtml:code> directory.  Ensure that it
has its own partition or logical volume at installation time, or migrate it
later using LVM. Make absolutely certain that it is large enough to store all
audit logs that will be created by the auditing daemon.
