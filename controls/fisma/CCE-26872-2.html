<p class="text-info">Failing to ensure all files are owned by a group is of <b>low</b> severity.</p>

<h3 style="border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;margin:30px 0 8px 0;">Rationale</h3>
<blockquote>
<p class=""><rationale xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">
Unowned files do not directly imply a security problem, but they are generally
a sign that something is amiss. They may
be caused by an intruder, by incorrect software installation or
draft software removal, or by failure to remove all files belonging
to a deleted account. The files should be repaired so they
will not cause problems when accounts are created in the future,
and the cause should be discovered and addressed.

<p><description xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">If any files are not owned by a group, then the
cause of their lack of group-ownership should be investigated.
Following this, the files should be deleted or assigned to an
appropriate group.
