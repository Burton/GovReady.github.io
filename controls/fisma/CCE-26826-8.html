<p class="text-info">Failing to ensure that root's path does not include relative paths or null directories is of <b>low</b> severity.</p>

<p class=""><rationale xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">
Including these entries increases the risk that root could
execute code from an untrusted location.

<h3 style="border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;margin:50px 0 8px 0;">Technical Description</h3>
<p><description xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">
Ensure that none of the directories in root's path is equal to a single
<xhtml:code>.</xhtml:code> character, or
that it contains any instances that lead to relative path traversal, such as
<xhtml:code>..</xhtml:code> or beginning a path without the slash (<xhtml:code>/</xhtml:code>) character.
Also ensure that there are no "empty" elements in the path, such as in these examples:
<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PATH=:/bin
PATH=/bin:
PATH=/bin::/sbin</pre>
These empty elements have the same effect as a single <xhtml:code>.</xhtml:code> character.
