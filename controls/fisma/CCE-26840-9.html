<p class="text-info">Failing to verify that all world-writable directories have sticky bits set is of <b>low</b> severity.</p>

<h3 style="border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;margin:30px 0 8px 0;">Rationale</h3>
<blockquote>
<p class=""><rationale xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">
Failing to set the sticky bit on public directories allows unauthorized users to delete files in the directory structure.
<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/><br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/>
The only authorized public directories are those temporary directories supplied with the system, 
or those designed to be temporary file repositories.  The setting is normally reserved for directories 
used by the system, by users for temporary file storage (such as <xhtml:code>/tmp</xhtml:code>), and for directories 
requiring global read/write access.

<h3 style="border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;margin:50px 0 8px 0;">Technical Description</h3>
<p><description xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">When the so-called 'sticky bit' is set on a directory,
only the owner of a given file may remove that file from the
directory. Without the sticky bit, any user with write access to a
directory may remove any file in the directory. Setting the sticky
bit prevents users from removing each other's files. In cases where
there is no reason for a directory to be world-writable, a better
solution is to remove that permission rather than to set the sticky
bit. However, if a directory is used by a particular application,
consult that application's documentation instead of blindly
changing modes.
<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/>
To set the sticky bit on a world-writable directory <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">DIR</i>, run the
following command:
<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"># chmod +t <i>DIR</i></pre>
