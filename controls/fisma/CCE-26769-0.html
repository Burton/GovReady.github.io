<blockquote>
<p class=""><rationale xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">Executable files with the SGID permission run with the privileges of
the owner of the file. SGID files of uncertain provenance could allow for
unprivileged users to elevate privileges. The presence of these files should be
strictly controlled on the system.</rationale></p>

<p><description xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">The SGID (set group id) bit should be set only on files that were
installed via authorized means. A straightforward means of identifying
unauthorized SGID files is determine if any were not installed as part of an
RPM package, which is cryptographically verified. Investigate the origin
of any unpackaged SGID files.
