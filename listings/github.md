desc1: GitHub is a web-based hosting service for software development projects that use the Git revision control system. GitHub offers both paid plans for private repositories, and free accounts for open source projects.
desc2: The site provides social networking functionality such as feeds, followers, wikis (using gollum Wiki software) and the social network graph to display how developers work on their versions of a repository. GitHub also operates other services -- a pastebin-style site called Gist that provides wikis for individual repositories and web pages that can be edited through a Git repository, a slide hosting service called Speaker Deck, and a web analytics platform called Gauges.
