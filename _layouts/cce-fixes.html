    <h3>About</h3>

    <p>FISMA is the mandated risk management framework for protecting information on Federal Government IT systems.</p>

	<p>An official list of FISMA recommended controls for non-DOD IT systems is described in large part by NIST Special Publication 800-53. Within government, people informally refer to the controls as "the 800-53's".</p>

	<p>Platform specific implementations of the 800-53's are formally known as Common Configuration Enumeration and informally refered to as "CCE's". This page is the list of 800-53 CCE's for RHEL6/CentOS6/Fedora Linux</p>
